## Installation and Setup
* If you don't have it installed, download and install Node.js 12.3.1
* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* `$ npm install` This will allow you to have access to the CLI (command line interface) for webpack.
* `$ npm run build`
This will automatically build the bundle once. The entry file is `./src/script/index.js`, with production ready code (minified).
